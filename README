Need to figure out if the fields need to be changed. Trouble when deleting if we only have the same name for the town.
Do we need he streetname also right?
It would make sens to have the streetname also, then the route to delete would be fields/cityname/streetname.
This would make each field more unique not just by the coordinates, also makes it easier to search later on.
